# Less is more

what you own, owns you.
computers were a mistake. so tired of wasting so much time and energy fighting my computer because it decided to stop working for some unknown reason.
the less the better.
this ought to be enough to have a productive environment without all the extra fluff, so it (probably, maybe, idk, probably not) won't break every odd day.

> as i was writing this, i encountered a treesitter error, i love computers.

this is basically the opposite of [shinobu](https://github.com/mluna-again/shinobu); its ugly as hell, but fast and lightweight.
anyways, i'll just go back to my old config because im dumb.
